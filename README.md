# SDC Microservice Versions Dashboard
This repository contains a dashboard application implemented using [Go](https://golang.org/) that shows which versions of the Survey Data Collection (SDC) platform microservices are deployed to which environment, using information held by the [SDC Microservice Versions Git repository](https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdc-service-versions).

## Prerequisites
* Install the [Godep](https://github.com/tools/godep) package manager using `go get github.com/tools/godep`
* Run `godep get` to download and install the other dependencies managed by Godep

## Building
Install Go and ensure your `GOPATH` environment variable is set (usually it's `~/go`).

### Make
A Makefile is provided for compiling the code:

```
make
```

The compiled executable is placed within the `build` directory tree.

## Cleaning
To clobber the `build` directory tree that's created when running `make`, run:

```
make clean
```
